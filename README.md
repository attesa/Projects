# Projects

In this repository, I put data analysis projects I have done for real-world data by using different statistical models and algorithms in **machine learning** or **deep learning**. 

To complete each project, I mainly use Python and some useful libraries, such as **NumPy** (for vectorization calculation), Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis), **SciPy** (for scientific computing), **Matplotlib** (for plotting), **nltk** (for natural language processing), and **sckit-learn** (for machine learning).
