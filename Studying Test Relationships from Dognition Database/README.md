# Studying Test Relationships from Dognition Database 

In this project, at first I implemented ERDPlus to **draw the relational schema** as shown in [Relational_schema.png](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/Studying%20Test%20Relationships%20from%20Dognition%20Database/Relational_Schema.png) to figure out what fields in each table and the relations between tables. Then I used **MySQL** to query the *test relationships between test completion and dog characteristics as well as testing circumstances in Dognition database*. These exercises are done in the course, "Managing Big Data with MySQL" by Duke University.
