# Predicting house pricing in Seattle

In this project, I implemented learning algorithms "from scratch" by using a **Tensorflow** framework and coded them in **object oriented programming** as shown in [Regression.py](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20house%20pricing%20in%20Seattle/Regression.py). I used data on house sales, located in Seattle, in King County to predict house prices by implementing various models:

1. [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20house%20pricing%20in%20Seattle/Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb), including one feature only
2. Multiple Regression by using closed form and gradient descent algorithm
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Ridge Regression
5. LASSO to select features
6. k-nearest Neighbors Regression
